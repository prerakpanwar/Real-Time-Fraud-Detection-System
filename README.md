# Real-Time-Fraud-Detection-System 

Tools used: Docker, Kafka, Mysql, Python, Machine Learning, Flask, VsCode, Jupyter labs

Phase 1 (Testing basic connections: completed)

Consistes of :
1-Testing Real time transactions data is getting produced using kafka producer.
2-Testing that the transactions data sent is getting consumed successfully by kafka consumer.
3-Before getting consumed, made a Risk Profile for the users in a table in MySQL.
4-Storing the consumed raw transactions in a table in MySQL successfully.

Phase 2 (Full working project):

For final code files please refer "Final Code Files" folder. Also, I wont be using any risk profile concept now.

(*Recommended*) Please go through the Project_Report.pdf file for detailed description of the project.

Feel free to email me for any feedback/doubts :)

Thank you!
